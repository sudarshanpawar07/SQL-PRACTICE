# SQL-PRACTICE

This repository contains my practice of SQL queries and concepts.  
I use it to learn, experiment, and consolidate my understanding of database querying.

## 📌 Topics Covered

- **SELECT / WHERE**  
- **ORDER BY / DISTINCT / OPERATORS**  
- **JOINs**  
- **GROUP BY / HAVING**  
- **Subqueries**  
- **Functions (aggregate, string, date etc.)**  
- **Mock queries / real-like examples**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- To strengthen my ability to write accurate, efficient SQL queries.  
- To build confidence in handling data retrieval, aggregation, and relationships.  
- To prepare for technical interviews and assessments involving databases.

## 🛠 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sudarshanpawar07/SQL-PRACTICE.git
   ```

2. Open the folder of a topic you want to practise (e.g. `JOINS/`, `SUBQUERY/`).
